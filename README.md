# AWS Baseline

Defines esssential baseline resources that should exist in every AWS account.
This project is intended to be a combination of best practices documentation
with a step-by-step guide on setting up an AWS account in A Right Wayâ„¢ (or at
least that's what I'm calling it).

To assist in implementing these practices, they have been codified as much as
possible with Terraform. I hope to add more provisioning options in the future,
as this project continues to move towards providing a set of structured data
that can be consumed by various tooling, for the most truest sense of freedom.

## Maturity
