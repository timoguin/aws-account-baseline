# Overview

This set of documents outline the baseline essentials that should be applied in
every AWS account.

It is intended to be a combination of best practices documentation with a
step-by-step guide on setting up an AWS account in A Right Wayâ„¢ (or at least
that's what I'm calling it).

To assist in implementing these practices, they have been codified as much as
possible with Terraform. We hope to add more provisioning options in the
future, as this project continues to move towards providing a set of structured
data that can be consumed by various tooling, for the most truest sense of
freedom.
